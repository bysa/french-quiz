I can’t eat anymore!
I am full up/ I am satisfied
we understand each other most of the time
but as soon as she starts to translate...
I get lost
you do not make any mistakes in English
we are not going to argue again
we fight/argue all the time
I’ve already eaten too much
me neither
Do you fancy a little Ricard? 
a small Ricard will go down very well
it is warm/mild outside.
I will not be able to sleep if I have a coffee at this time
That’s obvious
I will bring them to you on the terrace
